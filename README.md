# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

Our goal is to create a movie recommendation system based on the concept of collaborative filtering. 
Collaborative filtering (CF) is a popular recommendation algorithm that bases its predictions and recommendations on the ratings or behavior of other users in the system. 

#### Approach 1: User to User CF
Find similar users and recommend movies that they like.

#### Approach 2: Item to Item CF
Find similar movies based in ratings given by other users
